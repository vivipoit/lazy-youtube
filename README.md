# lazy-youtube  

For years I've used this for lazy loading images:  
http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/  

It works well!  

Today I decided to get into lazy loading the YouTube iframes and found this:  
https://github.com/alexpts/jquery.lazy-youtube  

Generally speaking, it also works just fine. It was simple to introduce into the project and easy to use right away.  

After a while, I found myself tweaking this a bit, though, so I decided to share an example of my current setup.
