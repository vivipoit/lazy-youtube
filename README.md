# lazy-youtube  
  
For years I've used this for lazy loading images:

It has worked quite well!  

Today I decided to get into lazy loading the YouTube iframes and found this:

Generally speaking, it also works quite well. It was simple and easy to introduce and use right away.  

After a while I found myself tweaking this quite a bit, so I decided to share an example of my current setup.
